      <p><strong>Newfoundland</strong> is a large breed of working dog. They can be black, grey, brown, or black and white. However, in the Dominion of Newfoundland, before it became part of the confederation of Canada, only black and Landseer coloured dogs were considered to be proper members of the breed. <em>Enjoy :)</em></p>

      <h2>History</h2>
      <h3>Health</h3>
      <blockquote>
        <p>A 2024 UK study found a life expectancy of 11 years for the breed compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds.

          Several conditions the Newfoundland is predisposed to include: acral lick dermatitis, allergic skin disease, hypothyroidism, ichthyosis, and primary seborrhoea.
          
          A study of referrals to a veterinary clinic in the US found the Newfoundland to be predisposed to dilated cardiomyopathy, with 1.3% of dogs having the condition. A Swedish study found 16% of Newfoundlands with DCM to have ventricular ectopy.[11] An English study found 77% of Newfoundlands with DCM to have atrial fibrillation.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <h3>Origin</h3>
      <p>Genome analysis indicates that Newfoundlands are related to the Irish water spaniel, Labrador Retriever, and Curly-Coated Retriever. The Newfoundland was originally bred and used as a working dog for fishermen in Newfoundland. In the early 1880s, fishermen and explorers from Ireland and England travelled to the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, where they described two main types of working dogs. One was heavily built, large with a longish coat, and the other medium-sized in build – an active, smooth-coated water dog.</p>
      <h3>Reputation</h3>
      <p>The breed's working role was varied. Many tales have been told of the courage displayed by Newfoundlands in adventuring and lifesaving exploits. Over the last two centuries, this has inspired a number of artists, who have portrayed the dogs in paint, stone, bronze, and porcelain. One famous Newfoundland was named Seaman, one of the most traveled dogs in human history, who accompanied American explorers Lewis and Clark on their expedition from the Mississippi to the Pacific and back, a journey that took three years. A statue of him is included in many Lewis and Clark monuments. Many children's books have been written about him.</p>
      <p>Other famous Newfoundlands: </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Bashaw (Matthew Cotes Wyatt): the Earl of Dudley's favourite dog, and the inspiration for a sculpture by Matthew Cotes Wyatt at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London</li>
        <li>Bilbo: a lifeguard Newfoundland on Sennen beach in Cornwall—credited with saving three lives</li>
        <li>Boatswain: pet of English poet Lord Byron and the subject of his poem "Epitaph to a Dog". Byron attempted to nurse Boatswain back to health when the dog contracted rabies, but was unsuccessful. When Boatswain died, Byron constructed a monument for him at Newstead Abbey.</li>
        <li>Bouncer: presented by the children of Newfoundland, with a dog-cart,[33] as a gift to the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York (later George V and Queen Mary), during their visit to the colony in 1901</li>
